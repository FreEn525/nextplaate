# Changelog

## 5.5

**Settings**
- New Settings drawer (gear icon): each feature can be switched off. A switched-off feature has no controls, no key and no Esc step; what depends on it goes off too (descriptions need the location and hashtags).

**Plate check**
- Greece: cars and most types read the two-letter code then the letter (KZT, ITI), trucks too (IAZ), taxis the letter then the code (TAE).
- Plate rules for many more countries: the plate read from the upload form now matches what the site shows for about 680 of its 829 categories (checked offline on 2188 real plates from the galleries, 93 % read back exactly). New or fixed rules include Russia, Greece, Croatia, Poland, Ukraine, Serbia, Germany, Slovakia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Latvia, Belarus, Albania, Armenia, Åland, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Iraq.
- Letters that the site writes itself in a grey field (ΞΑ, AM, E.A., FL, ZV...) are now part of the plate that is searched.
- Russian plates: the menus use the Latin look-alike letters, the galleries the Cyrillic ones; the check now accounts for it.

**Batch upload**
- Less memory: the previews in the batch window are 720 px wide instead of 1400 (a decoded picture takes four times less memory), which avoids the "Out of Memory" page crash with large batches.
- The plate type menu is found in Andorra and Malta (`drop_2`) and the Netherlands (no type menu) no longer gives an error.

**Under the hood**
- Source split into small files (one file per country for the plate rules); faster tests; data collected from the site organised in `data/`, with a coverage report in `docs/COUVERTURE.md`.
- The dev build keeps its own name ("NextPlaate (dev)") on Windows copies too.
